## 2D-particle-sim
A simple 2D particle heat transfer physics simulation made using the VPython library.

# to use
Simply run heat_transfer_sim.py and a browser window will open with the simulation. Click on the simulation to remove the middle barrier and observe the transfer of heat. In the program, set the HEAT_SOURCE_ENABLED variable to True in order to give one particle more kinetic energy over time. The PARTICLE_COUNT variable can also be altered with the expected result.
